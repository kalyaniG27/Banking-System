This Java code implements a simple Banking System. This project demonstrates key concepts in object-oriented programming and includes three classes: BankAccount, Bank, and BankingSystem.

BankAccount Class

- This class represents a bank account, storing information such as account number, account holder's name, and balance.
- It includes methods for:
    1.deposit: Deposits money into the account.
    2. withdraw: Withdraws money from the account.
    3. displayBalance: Displays the account balance.

Bank Class

- This class represents a bank, storing a list of bank accounts.
- It includes methods for:
    1. createAccount: Creates a new bank account.
    2. findAccount: Retrieves account information based on the account number.

BankingSystem Class

- This class represents the main menu of the banking system.
- The main method displays the banking system menu and performs actions based on user input.

How it Works

1. The user views the banking system menu and selects an action.
2. Based on the user's input, the banking system prompts for the account number and account holder's name.
3. Using the user's input, the banking system retrieves the account information and performs actions on the account (e.g., deposit, withdrawal, or balance check).
4. The banking system processes the user's actions and updates the account information.
